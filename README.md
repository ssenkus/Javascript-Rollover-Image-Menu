Javascript-Rollover-Image-Menu
==============================

A quick and dirty Javascript rollover menu!

This Javascript-based menu is a replacement for an old Adobe Flash animated menu.  A default main image is displayed with a menu on the right.  As the user mouses over each menu item, the main image & menu item change to sync with the moused-over menu item.  If the user moves the mouse outside the menu, the default image returns.  Simple and effective.

If you use it, make sure to preload your images.  Hidden divs (#hidden{ display: none; }) work great for this.
